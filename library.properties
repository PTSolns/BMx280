sentence=Library for BMP280 and BME280 sensor modules with emphasis on efficient single-burst reading to minimize I2C/SPI bus usage, while maintaining full compatibility with both continuous and forced-mode measurements.
paragraph=Auto-detects BME280 (T+P+H) vs BMP280 (T+P). Performs single-burst reads for synchronized data with minimal bus time. Supports I2C and 4â€‘wire SPI. Public API: read280()/readForced280(), setSampling() (oversampling, filter, standby, mode), status helpers.
